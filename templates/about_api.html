<h1>About our API</h1>

<p>
Making the data collected here useful to other developers
is a core part of our mission.
That's why we've made sure that every part of the site
is not just human-readable
but also machine-readable.
</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<p>
You'll notice at the bottom of most pages,
there's a note for developers
that links to a version of the page in
a variety of machine-readable formats:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    <strong>N3:</strong>
    (aka Notation3, Turtle, N-Triples Plus, etc.)
    <code>text/rdf+n3</code>
    </p>
    <p>
    This elegant text-based RDF format is our recommended method for
    getting our data.
    Most modern languages have an RDF toolkit that can parse and query
    against N3 inputs.
    For more information, visit <a href="http://rdfabout.com/">rdfabout</a>.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    <strong>JSON:</strong>
    (aka JavaScript Object Notation)
    <code>application/json</code>
    </p>
    <p>
    JSON is a simple text-based format for transporting objects.
    Most modern langauges have a JSON library that converts it
    into objects in your native language.
    For more information, visit <a href="http://json.org/">JSON.org</a>.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    <strong>XML:</strong>
    (aka RDF/XML)
    <code>application/rdf+xml</code>
    </p>
    <p>
    We use a constrained version of XML called RDF/XML
    that simplifies parsing and allows us to annotate values
    with their datatypes.
    Again, using an RDF library may make this format easier to parse.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Are there other formats you'd like? 
<a href="/about/#feedback">Let us know.</a>
</p>

<p>
To get at these formats, 
you can either add <code>.n3</code> 
or the appropriate file suffix to the end of the URL
(for example, 
<code><a href="http://watchdog.net/us/ak-00.n3"
>http://watchdog.net/us/ak-00.n3</a></code>)
or you can request the page with an HTTP <code>Accept:</code> header
that specifies the media type for the format you want. 
(The media types we use are listed next to the format name above.)
</p>

<p>
Here's an example using the command-line HTTP client <code>curl</code>:
</p>

<pre>
  <strong>\$ curl -s http://watchdog.net/us/ak-00 | head</strong>
  &lt;html>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>AK-00: Alaskaâ€™s at-large congressional district (watchdog.net)&lt/title>
  <em>[...]</em>
  
  <strong>\$ curl -s http://watchdog.net/us/ak-00.n3 | head</strong>
  @prefix : &lt;http://watchdog.net/about/api#> .

  &lt;http://watchdog.net/us/AK-00> a :District;
    :almanac &lt;http://nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2008/people/ak/rep_ak01.htm>;
    :area_sqmi 663267;
  <em>[...]</em>
  
  <strong>\$ curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" http://watchdog.net/us/ak-00 | head</strong>
  [
    {
      "almanac": "http://nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2008/people/ak/rep_ak01.htm", 
      "area_sqmi": 663267, 
      "center_lat": 65.831199999999995, 
  <em>[...]</em>
</pre>

<h3 id="State">States</h3>

<p>
You can get at states through URLs of the form 
<code>http://watchdog.net/us/va</code> -- 
there you'll find all the information we have on a given state.
</p>

<h3 id="District">Districts</h3>

<p>
Districts have URLs of the form
<code>http://watchdog.net/us/va-01</code>
where at-large districts have the number suffix <code>-00</code>.
</p>

<p>
For a full list of districts
(although not everything we have on each district)
visit <code>http://watchdog.net/us/</code>
</p>

<h3 id="Politician">Politicians</h3>
<p>
Politicians have URLs of the form
<code>http://watchdog.net/p/nancy_pelosi</code>
</p>

<p>
A full list of politicians
(although not everything we have on each of them)
can be found at
<code>http://watchdog.net/p/</code>
</p>

<h2>Queries</h2>

<h3 id="zip2rep">zip2rep / zip2dist</h3>

<p>
A common problem developers have 
is figuring out which congressional district
the user is located in.
Because congressional districts change frequently
and are heavily gerrymandered
this is a rather difficult problem.
</p>

<p>
We provide a simple API for solving this:
Give us a zip code or zip+4 and we'll give you back 
all the matching Congressional districts.
Give us a zip code and an address and we'll give you back
just the one that matches.
</p>

<p>
You can do these queries via URLs like
<code>http://watchdog.net/us/?zip=90210</code><br />
<code>http://watchdog.net/us/?zip=90210-5106</code><br />
and
<code>http://watchdog.net/us/?address=360+N+Rodeo+Dr&amp;zip=90210</code>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, we don't currently have fully machine-readable output
for these queries.
We're still thinking about the right way to do design the API.
If you need this, <a href="/about/#feedback">let us know</a>.

<p>
For the source code and data,
see the files <code>zip2rep.py</code> and <code>zipdict.txt</code>
in <a href="http://watchdog.net/code/?p=dev.git;a=tree;f=utils"
>our utils directory</a>.
</p>

<p>
The zip+4 information comes from the USPS
and is available in TSV format in our 
<a href="http://watchdog.net/data/load/zip4.tsv">zip4.tsv</a>
file.
